Exercise 1:
	For this exercise, it was asked of us to do a Synteny study on two varieties of Chlamydias.
	One of the parts of the experiment was to do a global alignment of the ORFs found in both the 
	muridarum and the caviae varieties. Using the given parameters for ORF finding, there were more
	than 900 ORFs found by NCBI ORF finder on each genome. Sadly, I was not able to make an alignment 
	in due time with such a large amuount of ORFs to align.

	So instead, I used the ncbi blast to align ang checked the dot matrix generated, which I attached.

	In the dot matrix: 
	Y-axis - Chlamydia Caviae
	X-axis - Chlamydia Muridarum
	Each dot is a gene simmilar enough and the axis metric is in nucleotides.

	As we can see, most of the genome got inverted between the two species, resulting in long stretches
	where the off diagonal is stronger. But there are also some somall chunks where synteny happens and some genes in the middle that look like they have been transposed a little, losing any kind of synteny.

Exercise 2: 
	I selected a small Synteny are from around base 670K to 730K in Muridarum. 770K to 830K in Ceviae:

	again using the NCBI tools, I was able to see the genes in that small area. also in an attached picture.
