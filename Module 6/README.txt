6th Module - Intro to Bioinformatics

---- Exercise 1 ----

In order to do this exercise, first I will get homologous genes
between Human and Chimp mithocondria and Human and Mouse mitochondral.
This can be easily retrieved from GenBank.

Then I have to align the genes and then apply the Neil Gorojobi algorithm
for Ka/Ks estimation and, therefore, Natural Selection measurement.
