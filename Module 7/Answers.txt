1.
	In this exercise, the first thing to do was to get an alignment of all the sequences. For that task, I used Clustal Omega. The output of the alignment can be found at the "genomes" folder.
	With the alignment at hands, I was able to write a quick python script to generate the phylogenetic trees as phyloxml files then used the xml files to plot both the tree with and without the Jukes Cantor correction using a site called Evolview. Interestingly, both situations generatad the same trees.
	As can be seen in the result trees in this folder, we have common ancestors with the apes, with the Chimpanzee being out closest relative. 
	The Neanderthal is also genetically closer to us Homo Sapiens than the apes.

2.
	Using the same procedures as in the first exercise, I was able to generate the phylogenetic tree for the immunodeficiency viruses sampled.
	Interestingly, it looks like the HIV-1 and HIV-2 have different origins, with the HIV-1 probably originating from Chimpanzees and the HIV-2, with it's genetic proximity with SIV from pigÂ­tailed macaque and maccaca mulatta, probably originated from Macaca genus.
