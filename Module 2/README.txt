2nd Module - Intro to Bioinformatics

Hello There Cynthia!

To use my python script, simply execute it from the command line. It should be able to find all the fasta
files without further help. The output is already made for all the exercises from Module 2

If the file is not executable, do a 'chmod 755 exercises.py' and it should work.
Linux... Access permission... This kind of stuff. 

Thanks a lot and Enjoy!
Bruno
